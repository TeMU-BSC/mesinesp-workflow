Task description

As part of the BioNLP-OST framework (https://2019.bionlp-ost.org/home), following the outline of previous chemical and drug NER efforts, we organize the first task on chemical and drug mention recognition from Spanish medical texts. This task will address the automatic extraction of chemical, drug, gene/protein mentions from clinical case studies written in Spanish.

Efficient access to mentions of drugs, medications and chemical entities is a pressing need shared by biomedical researchers, clinicians and pharma industry. The recognition of pharmaceutical drugs and chemical entities is a critical step required for the subsequent detection of relations of chemicals with other biomedically relevant entities.

The main aim is to promote the development of named entity recognition tools of practical relevance, that is chemical and drug mentions in non-English content, determining the current-state-of-the art, identifying challenges and comparing the strategies and results to those published for English data.

The PharmaCoNER task will be structured into two sub-tracks:

1) Track 1: NER offset and entity classification.

2) Track 2: Concept indexing.


Publications

As a venue to compile the results of the follow-up investigation, a journal special issue will be organized to be published a few months after the workshop. The specific journal will be announced. More information at the BioNLP-OST 2019 webpage.
