        Plan TL Sponsoring the MEDDOCAN Track
               MEDDOCAN Awards 3,400€
         1,000€ to each sub-track winner,
   500€ to the second and 200€ to the third teams


As part of the IberLEF 2019 (https://sites.google.com/view/iberlef-2019) initiative, we announce the first community challenge task specifically devoted to the anonymization of medical documents in Spanish, called the MEDDOCAN (Medical Document Anonymization) track.

There is a pressing need to identify automatically sensitive information to address, not only to privacy-related issues, but also to better characterize semantically content, in particular electronic health records. Recognizing entities corresponding to sensitive information is of critical importance and impact to enable access both to medical data and to other data resources.

The MEDDOCAN task will be structured into two sub-tracks:

1) Entity recognition and entity type classification (e.g. patient name, phone numbers addresses, etc.)
2) Sensitive span detection.


Publications
------------

Teams will be invited to send a IberLEF 2019 workshop proceedings system description paper.

We plan to invite selected works for full publication in a Q1 Journal – Special Issue devoted to MEDDOCAN. Invitation to the special issue will consider multiple aspects such as performance, novelty of the system, availability of the underlying system (software/web-service) as well as the workshop presentation.
