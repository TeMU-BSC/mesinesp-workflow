Dear {fullname}:

*** Call for Participation CodiEsp: Clinical Case Coding Task (eHealth CLEF 2020) ***

 

 

CodiEsp (eHealth CLEF– Multilingual Information Extraction) Shared Task on automatic assignment of ICD10 codes (procedures, diagnosis) track at CLEF 2020

http://temu.bsc.es/codiesp

 

Plan TL Award for the CodiEsp Track

 

 

The CodiEsp sub-tracks:

1.CodiEsp Diagnosis Coding sub-task (CodiEsp-D): will require automatic ICD10-CM [CIE10 Diagnóstico] code assignment.

2.CodiEsp Procedure Coding sub-task (CodiEsp-P): will require automatic ICD10-PCS [CIE10 Procedimiento] code assignment.

3.CodiEsp Explainable AI exploratory sub-task (CodiEsp-X). Systems are required to submit the reference to the predicted codes (both ICD10-CM and ICD10-PCS).



Task description

Clinical coding consists in the transformation (or classification) of medical texts written by clinicians into a structured or coded format using internationally recognized class codes.


These codes describe a patient’s diagnosis or treatment. This process is critical for standardizing clinical records; enable aetiology studies, monitor health trends, epidemiology studies, clinical and biomedical research, decision-making or even reimbursement.


As part of the eHealth CLEF (http://clef-ehealth.org) Multilingual Information Extraction Shared Task we organize CodiEsp: Clinical Case Coding Task (http://temu.bsc.es/codiesp). The CodiEsp task will address the automatic extraction and assignment of clinical coding (diagnosis and procedures) to clinical case documents in Spanish.


In addition data in Spanish, we will also release training, development, and test set document translations into English.


Participant systems have to automatically assign ICD10 codes (CIE-10, in Spanish) to clinical case documents, being evaluated against manually generated ICD10 codifications.


Publications and workshop

As in previous eHealth CLEF efforts, there will be an evaluation workshop allocated at CLEF 2020 where participating teams can present their systems and obtained results. Moreover, participating teams will be invited to submit their system description papers for publication at the CLEF 2020 Working Notes proceedings. For previous working notes see: http://ceur-ws.org/Vol-2125/

 

CodiEsp awards

There will we three awards for the three top-scoring teams promoted by the Spanish Plan for the Advancement of Language Technology (Plan TL) and the Barcelona Supercomputing Center (BSC).
