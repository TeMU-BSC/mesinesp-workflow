Dear {fullname},


I hope you are doing well. Due to your interest in our ProfNER shared task, we thought you might be interested in participating in the upcoming MEDDOPROF track we are organizing in the context of IberLEF/SEPLN2021.



To make participation easier we follow a similar format and setting as in the past track.



It would be nice if you would consider participation or otherwise sharing the call with contacts/colleagues/students that you think might potentially be interested.


Note that the task will focus on the recognition of profession mentions in medical text, which is of key medical relevance due to the association of professions and occupations at different levels to diseases (e.g. occupational accidents, work-related exposure to hazardous substances, allergens or even pathogens and infectious agents, issues related to mental health and work-related stress,..). So we foresee that the MEDDOPROF track will be a valuable contribution to improve healthcare outcomes, both at the level of prevention, diagnosis as well as treatment.



Best regards,

MEDDOPROF Shared Task (IberLEF - SEPLN 2021) 

 Medical Documents Profession Recognition shared task

MEDDOPROF Cup Awards by BSC-Plan TL [2,700€]




We are organizing the first shared task focusing on automatic recognition of professions and occupational status (and normalization to standard multilingual terminologies) in medical documents.

The relevance of text mining of professions and occupational status encompasses multiple human-interest areas, from health and social services, competitive intelligence, human resources, legal NLP and even gender studies. 

The need to implement advanced NER systems to detect professions in medical texts has been underscored by the current pandemic, in which the risk of selected occupational groups has resulted in higher mortality and morbidity for these segments of the population. The relationships between disorders and professions may be explained by different factors like increased contact/exposure to hazardous substances, allergens or pathogens; physical injuries due to occupational accidents; higher degrees of social interaction of some professions, or even work-related conditions affecting mental health, just to name a few.

Additionally, targeted vaccination plans also benefit from better characterization of patient professions. 

Following the success of previously organized shared tasks (i.e. Cantemist, PharmaCoNER, or Meddocan), we are now launching the MEDDOPROF shared task as part of the IberLEF 2021 evaluation initiative (co-located with SEPLN 2021), with the following sub-tracks:




MEDDOPROF-NER: automatic detection of mentions of occupations (profession, employment status and activities).

MEDDOPROF-CLASS: finding mentions of occupations and classifying them, whether they refer to the patients themselves, their family members or healthcare professionals.

MEDDOPROF-NORM: mapping detected occupation mentions to their corresponding concept identifiers from standard multilingual occupation terminologies (ESCO and SNOMED-CT).
